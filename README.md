<b> Hoffman Code </b>

<p>Hoffman coding algorithm is commonly used for lossless data compression. It has two features:  
<li> These variable-length codes are designed as prefix codes, ensuring that the code assigned to one character is never a prefix of the code assigned to any other character.</li>
<li> The codes are assigned based on the frequency. So, if a character has more frequency, it will have the smallest length code assigned to it. So that the weighted length of codes for all the symbols (weighted by the usage frequency) is minimized.</li></p>
